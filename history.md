# The Move
At the end of the representing the RSGB HQ Stn 40M SSB in the IARU Contest Ken received news from the farmer of the Weobley Castle Farm that we had to vacate the farm by the end of the year. This was dismal news following such an exciting and successful IARU contest.

However, Ken and Paul worked miracles and during September found another farmer willing to host our station and antennas. We all mucked in and by the middle of October 2018 all the antennas had been removed from the masts and moved from the north of the Gower Peninsular (AONB) the eight miles to the southern coastline.

The Farmer has given us the field that overlooks the south Gower headland, known as ‘the Paddock’. The fact that there are five gates to go through to reach the site enhances the security. The payback is, the most spectacular radio site you are ever likely to encounter. You look straight over the beautiful headland into Bristol Channel and on a good day see the majestic isle of Lundy and beyond. There is a one hundred and eighty degree panorama over the Sea, and three hundred and sixty degree take-off without any hills or buildings.

It is exposed to the prevailing south westerly’s and we have already experienced some very strong winds. We have the SteppIR antennas to rebuild and site the mobile shack and generator. However, we are all extremely excited about the new site and can start to imagine when we have it up and running….‘CQ Contest, Golf Whisky Four Charlie Charlie’.
